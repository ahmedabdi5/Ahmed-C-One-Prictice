# Week 2 -- Processing Data

## Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students should be able to:

-   Read user input using TextBox controls.
-   Declare and use variables with suitable data types.
-   Perform calculations and convert numeric input and output.
-   Format numbers and handle simple exceptions.
-   Use constants, fields, and the Math class.
-   Improve a form's GUI and use debugging tools to find logic errors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Reading Input with TextBox Controls

A **TextBox** allows users to enter or edit text. Its **Text** property
stores the entered value as a string, and its content can be cleared
when needed.

## 2. Variables and Data Types

A **variable** is a named storage location in memory. It must be
declared before use, and its data type determines what kind of value it
can store.

-   **string:** Stores text, such as names or phone numbers.
-   **int:** Stores whole numbers.
-   **double:** Stores real numbers, including fractional values.
-   **decimal:** Stores precise decimal values, commonly used for
    financial calculations.
-   **var:** Lets the compiler infer a local variable's type from its
    initial value.

Variable names should be meaningful, contain no spaces, and avoid
reserved keywords. A variable must be assigned a value before it is
used.

## 3. String Concatenation and Variable Scope

**String concatenation** joins strings together, commonly using the `+`
operator. **Local variables** are declared inside a method and can only
be accessed there. **Scope** is where a variable can be used;
**lifetime** is how long it exists in memory.

Variables with the same name cannot be declared in the same scope.
Assigned values must be compatible with the variable's data type.

## 4. Numeric Data Types and Calculations

C# provides arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and finding a remainder. Expressions follow
the usual order of operations; parentheses can clarify the intended
order.

Dividing two integers produces an integer result, discarding any
fractional part. Mixed numeric types can affect the result type, and
some combinations, such as `double` and `decimal`, require conversion
before calculation.

**Type casting** explicitly converts a value from one data type to
another.

## 5. Inputting and Outputting Numeric Values

TextBox input is read as a string, even when the user types a number.
Parsing methods such as `int.Parse`, `double.Parse`, and `decimal.Parse`
convert numeric text to a numeric type.

To display a numeric value in a Label, TextBox, or message box, convert
it to a string, commonly with the **ToString** method. The `+` operator
can also combine text with numeric values.

## 6. Formatting Numbers

The **ToString** method can format numbers for display. Common format
strings include:

-   **N:** Number format.
-   **F:** Fixed-point format.
-   **E:** Exponential format.
-   **C:** Currency format.
-   **P:** Percentage format.

## 7. Simple Exception Handling

An **exception** is an unexpected error during program execution, such
as invalid numeric input or division by zero. Exception handling allows
an application to respond instead of stopping abruptly.

-   **try block:** Contains statements that may cause an exception.
-   **catch block:** Contains the response when an exception occurs.
-   **Exception Message:** Provides a description of the error.

## 8. Named Constants and Fields

A **named constant** is a named value that cannot be changed during
program execution. Constants are declared with the `const` keyword.

A **field** is a variable declared at class level, outside methods. Its
scope is the class, allowing class methods to access it.
